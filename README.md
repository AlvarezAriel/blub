# Blub
Experimenting with GPU driven 3D fluid simulation on the GPU using [WebGPU-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs).  
Focusing primarily on hybrid approaches lagrangian/eularian approaches here (PIC/FLIP/APIC..).

For SPH (pure lagrangian) fluid simulation, check out my simple 2D DFSPH fluid simulator, [YASPH2D](https://github.com/Wumpf/yasph2d).

To learn more about fluid simulation, check out [my Gist on CFD](https://gist.github.com/Wumpf/b3e953984de8b0efdf2c65e827a1ccc3) where I gathered a lot of resources on the topic.

## Name

From German *[blubbern](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blubbern)*, to bubble.  
Found out later that there was a [water park in Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blub_(water_park)) with that name, but it closed down in 2002.
